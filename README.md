## Welcome to MaroofSha!



WELCOME  






We are a part of MaroofSha & we handcraft herbal soaps & detergents in  micro scale.



### Our Journey


From handmade natural soaps to laundry bars, come along as we journey through the chemistry & artistry of soap making. We use organic herbs & spices as additives & soap colorants. 





We hope you love our natural & handcrafted soap recipes & enjoy trying them out sometime. We are a part of MaroofSha's team. MaroofSha is a microscale family organization handcrafting food, personal care products & custom made dresses.




All our products are handcrafted with special care with organic additives from local gardens.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/maroofsha/maroofsha.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
