<h1>Hi there, We are MaroofSha!</h1>

<p>
  We are of the same family &amp; we handcraft herbal soaps &amp; detergents in micro scale.</p>


<h1>Our Journey</h1>

<p>From handmade natural soaps to laundry bars, come along as we journey through the chemistry &amp; artistry of soap making. We use organic herbs &amp; spices as additives &amp; soap colorants. 

We hope you love our natural &amp; handcrafted soap recipes &amp; enjoy trying them out sometime. We are a part of MaroofSha's team. MaroofSha is a microscale family organization handcrafting food, personal care products &amp; custom made dresses.
  
  All our products are handcrafted with special care with organic additives from local gardens.</p>
