<h1>Hi there, We are MaroofSha!</h1>

<p>
We are of the same family & we handcraft herbal soaps & detergents in micro scale.







### Our Journey





From handmade natural soaps to laundry bars, come along as we journey through the chemistry & artistry of soap making. We use organic herbs & spices as additives & soap colorants. 











We hope you love our natural & handcrafted soap recipes & enjoy trying them out sometime. We are a part of MaroofSha's team. MaroofSha is a microscale family organization handcrafting food, personal care products & custom made dresses.









All our products are handcrafted with special care with organic additives from local gardens.
