    <h2>Our Journey(blogs)</h2>
    <p>From handmade natural soaps to laundry bars, come along as we journey through the chemistry &amp; artistry of soap making. 
      We use organic herbs &amp; spices as additives &amp; soap colorants. We use both natural essential oils &amp; 
      lab made fragrance oils to scent our soaps depending on the demand. We hope you love our natural &amp; 
      handcrafted soap recipes &amp; enjoy trying them out sometime. Soap making is a part of MaroofSha. 
      We also prepare food delicacies like homemade chocolates, macaroons, cocoa candies, coconut candies, sesame candies &amp; 
      peanut candies as a part of our food blog.
      All our products are handcrafted with special care, with organic additives from local gardens.</p>
