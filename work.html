Our Journey(blogs)
From handmade natural soaps to laundry bars, come along as we journey through the chemistry & artistry of soap making. We use organic herbs & spices as additives & soap colorants. We use both natural essential oils & lab made fragrance oils to scent our soaps depending on the demand. We hope you love our natural & handcrafted soap recipes & enjoy trying them out sometime. Soap making is a part of MaroofSha. We also prepare food delicacies like homemade chocolates, macaroons, cocoa candies, coconut candies, sesame candies & peanut candies as a part of our food blog. All our products are handcrafted with special care, with organic additives from local gardens.
