All of MaroofSha's products are Handcrafted with love &amp; care...

# Our Journey (blogs)

From handmade natural soaps to laundry bars, come along as we journey through the chemistry &amp;
  artistry of soap making. We use organic herbs &amp; spices as additives &amp; soap colorants. 
  We use both natural essential oils &amp; lab made fragrance oils to scent our soaps depending on the demand. 
  We hope you love our natural &amp; handcrafted soap recipes &amp; enjoy trying them out sometime. 
  Soap making is a part of MaroofSha. We also prepare food delicacies like homemade chocolates, macaroons, cocoa candies, 
  coconut candies, sesame candies &amp; peanut candies as a part of our food blog. 
  All our products are handcrafted with special care, with organic additives from local gardens.
