Well. This is just about blogging & where to blog. I love everything about GitHub - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) & this is my first experience. I have used Google’s BlogSpot and it was real good. Then, wanting not to suddenly lose my blog, planned to shift to WordPress. Downloaded WordPress in a local host and started working on it. The ‘Blog maintaining’ part was bugging me. I did not want to worry about security issues & much of maintenance. 
Then I started missing BlogSpot and wanted a way in between BlogSpot and WordPress. I stumbled upon GitHub pages and Jekyll. Here I am, now, writing my second post. 
As far as I read, I could only make a simple blog in GitHub pages. Let me see how much I can tweak it with css to make my blog look the way I want.
